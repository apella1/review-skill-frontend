# Spaced Repetition Algorithm

Understanding how ReviewSkill schedules your reviews.

## Algorithm Overview

```typescript
interface ReviewInterval {
  easeFactor: number;
  interval: number;
  repetitions: number;
}

function calculateNextReview(
  performance: number,
  currentInterval: ReviewInterval,
): ReviewInterval {
  // Algorithm implementation details
}
```

## Factors Considered

- Previous performance
- Current interval
- Historical difficulty
- Time of day
- Learning patterns

## Customization

Adjust the algorithm through:

- Interval modifiers
- Ease factor adjustments
- Review thresholds
